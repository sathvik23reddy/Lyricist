# Lyricist
-> Lyricist is an Android app built using Kotlin which uses OkHttp3 to make an API call for the lyrics the user wishes to consume. 
-> The network call is made using Coroutines on a background IO thread, which prevents the UI Thread from being blocked in the fetch process.
-> Very basic yet very handy app! Link to app - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RCGx40E0deCQmTutmtHFtLGg2HwFr_xT?usp=sharing
